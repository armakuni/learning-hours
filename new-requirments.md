# Evolution of Design

The systems we build are in a constant state of flux as we improve the customer experience, adding and changing features
to ensure we have an application that meets the needs of our customers making their lives easier.

## Learning Goals
  - Understand how to use existing test to make larger scale refactorings that will enable the design to evolve 
  - Understand how to continue to avoid complexing in the code while the complexity of the application grows
