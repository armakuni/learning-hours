# Intro to Pair Programming

## Learning Goals
 - Understand the concept of pair programming and its benefits.
 - Experience the Driver-Navigator model of pair programming.
 - Introduce a pairing system for the upcoming sprint.

## Session Outline
  - **10 min connect**: sharing experiences with pairing
  - **10 min concept**: explaining pair programming
  - **20 min do**: hands-on pairing exercise
  - **10 min reflect**: the takeaways of pairing

### Connect - sharing experiences with pairing
- Divide into pairs or small groups.
- Discuss any past experiences with pair programming and what participants think about it.
- After a few minutes of discussion, ask a few pairs to report their thoughts to the group. Note these insights on a whiteboard or shared document.

### Concept - explaining pair programming
- Explain the basics: Two developers working together at one workstation. Introduce the Driver-Navigator model, where one person writes code (Driver) and the other provides feedback and reviews the code (Navigator).
- Highlight the benefits:
    - **Knowledge Sharing**: Pairing promotes skill and knowledge transfer.
    - **Quality Improvement**: Two sets of eyes reduce errors, no need for pull requests.
    - **Enhanced Problem Solving**: Collaboration leads to better solutions.
    - **Increased Focus**: Accountability, shared responsibility improves concentration.

### Do - hands-on pairing exercise
- Give a simple coding problem (e.g., LeapYear calculation) or discussion topic to work on together.
- Encourage frequent role-switching between Driver and Navigator, simulating a real-world pair programming session.
- After the exercise, ask each pair to share insights or solutions with the group.

### Reflect - the takeaways of pairing
- Summarize the main points of pair programming.
- Reinforce that for the upcoming sprint, no tickets will be assigned to individuals; all work will be done in pairs.
- Ask participants to write one takeaway from the session on a post-it or shared document.

### 10 min Q&A and open discussion
- **Q&A**: Open the floor for concerns or questions.
- **Discussion**: Discuss hesitations about pairing (e.g., time constraints, comfort levels) and provide solutions.

### Next Steps
- **Implementation Plan**: Explain how pairing will be organized for the next sprint, including scheduling and pair rotation.
- **Follow-Up**: Plan a reflection session after the sprint to discuss the teamâ€™s experience with pairing.
